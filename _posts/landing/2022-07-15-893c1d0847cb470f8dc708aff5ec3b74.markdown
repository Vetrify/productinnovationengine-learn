    a: >
      The <strong>Product Innovation Engine</strong> is a professional product management tool focused on guiding and tracking your Risk Assumptions Testing (RAT) programs. 
      <br/><br/>
      We ensure you find and stay on the fastest path to reaching your objectives. 
      <br/><br/>
      You get there fast by breaking away from the broken 'build-test-learn' cycle.  Instead you learn and test early while it is cheapest and easiest, BEFORE you build.  This maximizes your innovation velocity.

      </ul>
  - q: "How does the product innovation engine help you reduce risk?"
    a: >
      You reduce your risk because you put risk front and center of your entire innovation strategy.  You avoid making the typical mistakes from misinformation or confirmation bias. You can be more confident about your decisions and actions.
  - q: How does the product innovation engine help you make better decisions?
    a: >
      The product innovation engine helps you to make better decisions because you are making decisions based on data. <br/><br/>
      You avoid guessing or making moved based on incorrect assumptions. <br/><br/>
      
      Your confidence is much higher when you have evidence to supports your decision.  <br/><br/>
      
      We all know there are no guarantees.  But if your decision is wrong, then at least you have evidence to support that it was the best possible decision at the time. <br/><br/>
      And if your decision is right… you had the evidence to back it!
  - q: What will happen if I don't use the product innovation engine?
    a: >
      You will be guessing, hoping, and praying for success without any real knowledge to back up your assumptions. <br/><br/>
      
      This means that you will be more anxious and stressed out every day... and especially when things do not go as planned. <br/><br/>
      
      You will spend weeks in meetings trying to convince others of what needs to happen without any supporting data behind it …which means they may not believe in you! <br/><br/>
      
      You will spend more time defending your actions and ideas because no one else has any supporting data either!<br/><br/>
      
      When everyone is just guessing then they don't want to get blamed for a mistake…so they avoid taking risks! (Analysis Paralysis) And witout risk, there's no reward.<br/><br/>
      
      This lack of action leads to low morale which leads to high turnover rates! It's a vicious cycle that comes from a lack of information and knowledge!<br/><br/>

      Your career success depends on how well-informed and knowledgeable you are about the industry trends & best practices, successful strategies for success, and the specific details of your job role.<br/><br/>

      If you don't have the right information... or if you don't know what to do with that information, then it's a waste of time to even try to drive product innovation! You can only hope that some other people in your organization are smart enough and motivated enough to address the risks and solve problems quickly and effectively.
  - q: "How does the product innovation engine help me achieve success?"
    a: >
      The product innovation engine provides a collaborative, participative, knowledge-sharing process that helps you to take ideas from just being a good idea to becoming a marketable product. It provides the information and guidance that you need to become an innovative leader in your field.<br/><br/>

      The innovation engine will help you develop your skills for:
      <ul><li> Developing and testing new ideas</li>
      <li> Building a knowledge bank for people who are working on similar projects.</li>
      <li>Working with other members of your organization to co-create ideas.</li></ul><br/><br/>

      The product innovation engine lays out a process that is driven by the needs of the customer and is an opportunity for you to become a leader for your organization.<br/><br/> 

      The Product Innovation Engine helps you get all the information you need to become an effective innovator!
  - q: " What are the limitations of the product innovation engine?"
    a: >
      The Product Innovation Engine focuses solely on the early innovation process (which is the most important time to innovate).  But, it does not help you execute your product strategy.<br/><br/>



      The Product Innovation Engine does not help you with building customer personas, though it can help you assess your assumptions and get better information.<br/><br/>



      The product Innovation Engine does not go beyond simple surveys used to test assumptions.  The challenge you'll have here is that what people say and what they do are often not the same thing.  The Product Innovation Engine helps you figure out what you need to test in order to verify or disprove your assumptions but it does not help you build out or execute the tests (yet).<br/><br/>



      The Product Innovation Engine does not help you with building an organizational structure to support innovation.<br/><br/> 



      The Product Innovation Engine does not help you with building up or managing a team.<br/><br/>

      The Product Innovation Engine does not help you organize your business requirements.
  - q: "How can I use the Product Innovation Engine to develop a product strategy that drives results?"
    a: >
      The Product Innovation Engine helps you to develop a product strategy that drives results. The process will lay out the steps you need to take to develop your product ideas and translate them into marketable products.<br/><br/>



      The Product Innovation Engine will help you set goals and define your objectives. It will help you develop a product strategy that:<br/><br/>



      • Is focused on customer needs and value-added features.<br/><br/>



      • Is based on an understanding of what the competition is doing, but not exactly like them.<br/><br/>

      •  Is focused on learning fast and addressing risks before they become problems.<br/><br/>



      The Product Innovation Engine helps you get all the information you need to become an effective innovator!<br/><br/>
