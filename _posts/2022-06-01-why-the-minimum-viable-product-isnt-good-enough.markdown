Are you an entrepreneur?  If so, you’re likely constantly feeling around (sometimes in the dark) to find better ways to launch or grow your business.

 One of the most popular startup strategies today is the minimum viable product (MVP) model. The idea is that with this process, entrepreneurs test the viability of their ideas before going all-in on a new product or service. 

There is a severe problem though…. Not in the idea of an MPV, but the way it’s typically executed (which has drifted significantly offcourse from the original idea)

Many businesses are getting slammed at this stage because they think an MVP is a viable path to success. But, Unfortunately, because they don’t understand the underlying idea and principles, they are rocketing down the road, the breaks are out, and they are heading off a cliff.   

<p class="text-center max-w-7xl mx-auto">Why?</p>

It may be a hard pill to swallow, but customers don't care about your product. Customers want solutions to their problems.

For your startup to succeed, you need to put your focus on your customers first.  Not your product.

Let’s dive into the details and take a look at why the MVP approach is no longer enough to build a real business today.


### **Why the “Minimum Viable Product” isn’t good enough for your startup**

The MVP has been an important concept for a long time. 

It was first introduced in the 60s (yeah… before the internet was a thing).  The idea was to helping businesses test the viability of different ideas. However, the ecosystem, technology, and strategies for startups have changed dramatically since then - but the MVP has not. 

Today’s businesses fall into using the same outdated strategies and tactics that were relevant in the 60s. But things have changed. As a result, the MVP is no longer sufficient for today’s entrepreneurs.

Unfortunately, the way most MVPs are implemented today leads entrepreneurs away from the whole point of creating products in the first place. Too often MVPs are sub-par solutions desperately searching for a problem to solve to stay alive.

The problem is too much focus on the product (maybe because it’s the last word in the name) and not enough on the minimum viability (especially in serving your customers). 

The point ofyour product is to provide value and help people. The MVP focus risks putting too much emphasis on the product first and not enough on your customers.

Today, you have to do better to compete. In today’s business world, creating something people think is cool is a part of it, but it’s not enough for your success. 

You must first focus on solving your customers’ problems. Not only does this create better products, it also leads to sustainable sales and growth for your entire company.


### **The MVP Pitfall**

While the MVP model is supposed to help businesses test their ideas, it often leads entrepreneurs away from the point of creating products in the first place. 

The MVP focuses on the product first before it does anything to help you solve your customers’ problems. 

This leads to a false sense of success for both you and your customers. You might feel like your business is growing, but it’s only because you’re selling a product that no one actually buys - or needs. 

Likewise, your customers might feel like they got ripped off.  They are buying the product because it looks pretty and they think it might solve their problems - even though it doesn’t. 

You have to avoid this pitfall at all costs. If you want your startup to succeed, your focus needs to be zeroed in on your customers and their problems first. You should only be thinking about your product after you’ve proven there is value in solving the problem, you have a viable solution, and people will pay.


### **A better path to success: Focus on solving problems**

The best way to make your startup successful is to keep a tight focus on solving your customers’ problems right from the start.

This means that you shouldn’t be focused on any product specifics. Instead, you need to be solving the issues that your customers have. This can be done in a variety of ways, including: 

The trick to making your MVP successful is to focus on solving the issues that your customers are facing and creating a product that solves those problems. This is how you build a sustainable business that will outlast the competition. You don’t do this by focusing on your product first. Instead, you need to be solving your customers’ problems before you even create a product. This will allow you to create better products and a sustainable business that thrives long-term.


### **What You Should Be Testing Instead**

The best way for new entrepreneurs to launch a successful business is to test their assumptions about customer problems. This means that you should be testing to see if your customers actually have the problems you think they have. The best way to do this is to use customer interviews and surveys. You can also use one-on-one interviews and in-person focus groups. These are great ways to test your hypotheses about customer problems and get data on potential solutions. These are the same strategies that businesses have been using since the 60s. However, they’re more important than ever. In today’s business environment, businesses thrive when they have a laser-sharp focus on their customers. This means putting your customers’ problems above your product creation. It also means not worrying about creating the perfect product. Instead, you should focus on testing your hypotheses about customer problems.


### **Bottom line**

The idea underlying the MVP model is an important concept for business. However, many entrepreneurs misinterpret this strategy and don't get the intended value.

Don’t build solutions and then try to find problems that fit.  It’s not a recipe for success, but a poison pill.

Instead of focusing on testing your product ideas, shift to testing the value you provide to your customers first.

This means putting your focus on solving customers’ issues instead of creating products. This is the best way for entrepreneurs to launch successful businesses. 

Building a customer-centric company (not a product-centric one) allows your business to grow sustainably over the long term - which is the ultimate goal for any entrepreneur.
